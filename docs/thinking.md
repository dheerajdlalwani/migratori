## What do I have in mind with this tool?

This is a toy project for me to better understand how migrations are handled by frameworks like
- [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/migrations/#module-django.db.migrations)
- [Alembic - by SQLAlchemy](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/index.html) typically used by [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com)


## Do I know what I am doing?

No. I know what migrations and are why they are used but I don't have an idea of how they work.

This project is an attempt to understand what happens behind the scenes.

Might evolve into a tool people use, might be another one of my side projects which failed.
